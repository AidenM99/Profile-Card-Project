## My process

The first step I took in building this project was to sketch a rough design of what I wanted in MS Paint as I think it helps to be able to visualise all of the different
parts that are needed when I'm working on something. I then started laying out a general structure in HTML and allocating all of the content into their respective divs
according to my sketch. Once I was happy with my structure, I began styling it in CSS to be as accurate as possible to the design provided

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to use and modify multiple background images via .body {background-image:url("../images/bg-pattern-top.svg"), url("../images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg");}
- How to use a negative value to manipulate content such as .victor {margin-top:-50px;}
- How to use multiple css class selectors on a single HTML element and also the use of the !important tag
- What flexbox is and how to use it to more easily position content i.e. align-items, justify-content
- Letter spacing

### Continued development

I plan to continue using flexbox so that I can become better at it in the future. This was my first experience in using it so therefore I'm not completely satisfied with 
my current level of understanding.
